During the pandemic Lou participated in a few performances over zoom, but sort of disappeared from theater for a bit. They are overjoyed and grateful to be back and working with this group of amazing individuals in person. Theater is beautiful and important. Please keep others safe during this time so we can continue to share why.</p>
