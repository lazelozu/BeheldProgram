          <div class="col-lg-6 offset-lg-3"><p>The Order of The Masterhood collectively refers to the social classes within the all-women’s religious society, The Masterhood and The Order. The Masterhood—comprised of the Sole Mothers, the Mistresses, and the Sisters—is an advanced, literate, and independent society in which women and girls follow and commit strict rites and responsibilities, known as talents, to support themselves and their trade with outsiders. The Masterhood is led by three Sole Mothers, who recruit new Sisters and servants, oversee rites and events, manage trade, and educate the Mistresses and Sisters. The nine Mistresses support The Masterhood by arranging rites, facilitating trade, creating more advanced treatments/herbal medicine, and sometimes teaching their Sisters. The thirty Sisters aid these efforts through creating treatments and assisting with agriculture. The Order, composed of numerous servants, serve and sustain the operations and members of The Masterhood.</p></div>
