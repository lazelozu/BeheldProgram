		  <br>
		  <p>Originally from a monologue titled The First Dig and a scene based off the ideas: “Lavender”, “Spoon edges”, and “Reviving the dead”, Beheld was created in response to my spring semester Playwriting class’ interest in its mysterious atmosphere and my own enthusiasm at creating pieces that had a interesting journey. I felt drawn to continuing the story, often pondering questions about the bounds of tradition, the power of healing, and sisterhood. The result was a story set in the Medieval era that explored girls’ and women’s talents. It became a well-received final project for the class that I looked forward to submitting it to be produced by student clubs. 
		  </p>
		  <br>
		  <p>Shortly after New Ren chose to produce my first-ever play, the club and I agreed to write an addition to the brief story. I became interested in exploring the origins of Beheld’s The Order of The Masterhood and penned the prologue, The Passing of The Rite, which delves into the rites at the center of the all-women’s religious society. Throughout our workshops, rewrites, and rehearsals, the company (mostly) and I have worked tirelessly to develop both stories into an engaging story. Like us, we hope you find the show a wonder to behold.

		 <p> Sincerely,
		 </p>
